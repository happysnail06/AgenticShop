Now, with Buffalo Wing Soda in hand, I was about to imbibe yet another dubious offering from ol' Lester. With slight trepidation, I pried the bottle cap off of this evil beverage and took a sniff --&#34;Okay,&#34; I foolishly thought to myself, &#34;it smells a little bit strange, but not as bad as I expected.&#34; (I was in denial)! Finally, I took my first swig... In reality, it tasted sort of like a citrus soda that had been spiked with a couple teaspoons of hot sauce. The spiciness gave a slight burning sensation to my esophagus, and a funky aftertaste lingered for a while after I had finished the beverage. Subsequently, &#34;rot gut&#34; began to settle in, and any lingering &#34;open mindedness&#34; that I still had toward this soda faded away exponentially...<br />As I type this review, the empty bottle sits next to me; I've now become acutely and unequivocally aware of the noxious smell continually wafting from the opening: An unsettling hybrid scent of hot sauce and sickly sweetness.<br /><br />I like the novelity of this soda, but I don't think that I'll be drinking it again.<br />\u00a0",

                    "user_review": "During the late 1990's and early 2000's, this was one of my favorites. Back then, the 750ml bottle was the only option; I would purchase it to share with friends, trying to introduce them to something new in the beer world. Strangely, the beer then left the Minnesota markets for a couple of years. Needless to say I was quite displeased with this. Despite my efforts, there was just no way that I could logistically get my hands on this now precious and coveted ale. Then just a couple of years ago, Leffe resurfaced again - this time exclusively in 6 pack form. Moreover, it was now in virtually every liquor store that carried at least a minimal selection of imported beers. Although I was pleased that Leffe had returned, it just didn't feel quite right; it was now too ubiquitous, and I missed the old 750 ml corked bottles. Now, in the past year or so, the 750ml bottles have returned. Additionally, the sticker price is surprisingly much cheaper (approximately $4 - $6) than its Belgian competitors. Once again, I was glad to see the return of the quintessentially Belgian corked bottle for Leffe. However, the significantly reduced cost of the ale made me a bit suspicious. Regardless, like reacquainting with an old friend, I decided to pick up a bottle to see if Leffe was still one of Belgium's finest. While there is no doubt that Leffe is still a quality Belgian ale, there seems to be something slightly different with this product, some subtilities that seem to be lacking. I noticed it mainly in the finish of the beer; there seemed to be a vaguely noticeable &#34;thinness&#34; that I've sometimes associated with cheaper quality American brews. I started to &#34;smell a rat,&#34; so I decided to dig a little bit deeper into recent information about Leffe; what I uncovered made my heart sink a little bit...<br />It seems that one major step in the wrong direction for Leffe occurred in 2004. It was during this time that Interbrew, the company that owned the rights to Leffe, merged with the Brazilian brewing company AmBev. Changing the company name to InBev following the merger, the conglomerate earned itself a very negative reputation as a ruthless predator in the beer manufacturing world. It is also noteworthy to point out that this was roughly the same time period in which Leffe became conspicuously absent from the shelves of Minneapolis liquor stores. Coincidence? Maybe, but I'm willing to bet that it wasn't. In November 2008, InBev purchased Budweiser giant Anheuser-Busch for $52 billion. Changing the name to &#34;Anheuser-Busch InBev&#34; (or &#34;AB InBev&#34; for short), the newly formed conglomerate was now the world's #1 beer manufacturer. Moreover, multiple resources that I read cited the fact that AB InBev was now using corn and other cost-effective measures in their brewing process for Leffe -- something that was not being done previously. In one fell swoop, this explains the recent widespread distribution, the suspiciously low cost, and the noticeably different taste of a once great Belgian ale. As I write this, I keep shaking my head; I feel a bit duped and betrayed (unfortunately, Leffe is just the tip of the iceberg - other quality beers such as Franziskaner, Bass, Goose Island, and Hoegaarden are also owned by AB InBev).<br /><br />By most accounts that I've read, AB InBev seems to have garnered a reputation for buying up smaller beer companies and either callously altering their brewing processes (in the name of cost-effective measures) or working toward closing the products lines down altogether. There's lots of negative information out there in regard to this company... I may need to reconsider how often (if at all) I should purchase products that support such a dubious organization.",

According to information that I've read, this product was first introduced to U.S. markets in the late 1980's.  However, at least in this part of the country, it hasn't made much of an impact.

The image on the bottle comes strait from the comic series; a hillbilly named \"Hairless Joe,\" and a Native American named \"Lonesome Polecat\" are raising bottles into the air in celebratory fashion, lauding the creation of their mysterious libation.  Were this product to be mass marketed today, I'm fairly certain that there would be a slight backlash in regard to the negative racial stereotypes being portrayed.  However, for those who grew up reading the Li'l Abner series, this niche soda seems to serve as a nice bit of nostalgia.  As for the flavor of this beverage, it pretty much tastes like Mountain Dew or Mello Yellow, sweetened with sugar rather than high fructose corn syrup.",

I pried open the bottle and took a sniff, wherein I noticed a slightly herbal scent; considering the long list of herbal ingredients on the label, this wasn't particularly suprising.  I then poured the nearly blood red elixir into a cup and took an initial swallow.  I was rather suprised by the initial bitterness of the soda; it definitely wasn't what I was expecting!  Continuing with a couple more swallows, I then started to notice a slight burning sensation in my esophagus -- this, no doubt, came from the jalape\u00f1o oil that was infused into the beverage.  I wasn't sure if I liked this soda at first.  However, the more that I drank it, the more that I came to enjoy this bizarre concoction.  It also seemed to cure my morning craving for caffeine, so that was pretty cool too.  My co-workers weren't so thrilled with this beverage, but I thought that it was pretty good. At the very least, it makes for good discussion as a novelty item.",

Finally, I took my first swig...  In reality, it tasted sort of like a citrus soda that had been spiked with a couple teaspoons of hot sauce.  The spiciness gave a slight burning sensation to my esophagus, and a funky aftertaste lingered for a while after I had finished the beverage. Subsequently, \"rot gut\" began to settle in, and any lingering \"open mindedness\" that I still had toward this soda faded away exponentially...<br />As I type this review, the empty bottle sits next to me; I've now become acutely and unequivocally aware of the noxious smell continually wafting from the opening:  An unsettling hybrid scent of hot sauce and sickly sweetness.<br /><br />I like the novelity of this soda, but I don't think that I'll be drinking it again.",

So naturally, I made yet another pilgrimage to JIM'S APPLE FARM (if you're going to be visiting southern MN between now and Thanksgiving, I highly recommend paying them a visit). As is par for the course during this time of year, the place was overrun with throngs of crazy apple lovers.  Apples are nice and all, however, the REAL treasures found at this place are all of the amazing variants of candy and, especially, the dozens of bizarre brands of soda that line the shelves!  Fighting my way past the \"Honeycrisp Harolds\" and the \"apple butter Bettys,\" I finally found myself standing in front of the state's largest selection of off-the-wall sodas - truly a sublime thing to behold!  The last time that I visited this soda pop mecca, I left slighty disappointed because I wasn't financially prepared to delve in unfettered.  This time, however, I came prepared and bought a bevy of rainbow colored, carbonated ambrosia;  among my numerous selections was the wonderfully retro GOODY BLUE POP.  Electric blue in color, sweetened with pure cane sugar and \"natural and artificial flavors,\" -- It's pretty much what you'd expect (complete with a noticable aftertaste either from the Blue # 1 dye, the cane sugar, or both).  I don't think that I'd purchase a whole 12 pack of this soda. However, for nostalgia's sake, it would be worth purchasing a couple of bottles.  Get at least a half dozen people willing to chip in, and THEN purchase a 12 pack of this stuff!",

First of all, the California Prop65 warning on each packet is a little unsettling\u2014I believe it has something to do with the pouch the candy is packaged in and not the food itself, but it still gave me an icky feeling as I was gearing up to try these. The actual gummies have good flavor and texture, but they taste so much like my elderberry zinc gummies that I take when I\u2019m trying to fight off a cold, so this correlation is hard for me to mentally get over and think of these as a candy substitute and not a vitamin.

The texture is a little softer (less chewy) than traditional gummy worms, but they definitely still make you feel like you\u2019re eating a gummy treat. The sour coating is perfect, and \u201cauthentic\u201d to other sour gummies. I was expecting really long worms based on the picture, but they\u2019re actually on the shorter side (about 3/4 the length of my pinky finger). I had no trouble eating the whole mini bag, and enjoyed every bite.  I didn\u2019t feel guilty about it either knowing these aren\u2019t loaded with sugar. Glad that 8 bags in this multipack for lots of snacking. Price is a little high, but they\u2019re a great treat!",

They really have a perfect chewy texture, great fruit flavor, and the sour ones have spot-on tartness comparable to the patch kids. I've also tried other low sugar gummy candy (Smart Sweets), but these have a better texture and flavor to me. Just be careful about eating too many due to the fiber content. A serving is a whole pouch, but that is too much for my GI tract (half a pouch is about right for me), but I will definitely restock these because of the excellent taste without the sugar!",

All get used even in summer..Weekends relaxing or before work.",

A shade lighter than most of our offerings\u2014more toasty than roasty\u2014it was the result of playing with roast and taste profile together for a flavor that appealed to a wider range of palates.

So I was curious to see how hazelnuts would work with the basic &#34;formula.&#34;<br /><br />The bottom line:  this is still the same basic Snickers bar:  caramel, nougat, chocolate, and peanuts -- with the addition of some hazelnuts.  I get the hazelnut flavor -- barely perceptible, but present.  But if &#34;Hazelnut&#34; is going to be featured on the label, I would expect the flavor to be more pronounced.<br /><br />On the plus side -- you get two &#34;bars&#34; in each large package: one for now, and one for later, so that's a nice packaging plus.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong -- these are still very good as far as &#34;Snickers&#34; is concerned.  But they need to increase the proportion of hazelnuts (eliminating some of the peanuts) to make it worth the prominence of labeling this as &#34;SNICKERS Hazelnut.&#34;<br /><br />If you want a traditional Snickers with just a hint of hazelnut flavor, these will work.  But otherwise, just go for the regular Snickers.",

Hershey's is a decent brand, with generally good products, not as good as some brands, but probably better than others.  So I kind of knew what to expect with these almond chocolate bars.<br /><br />You get 5 large-ish milk chocolate bars with just the right amount of crunchy almonds.  Each bar breaks into 8 nuggets -- reminiscent of [[ASIN:B001FA1DZK Hershey's Nuggets, Milk Chocolate with Almonds, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)]].  Yes, the quality is consistent with Hershey's brand -- creamy, a bit sweet (it is, after all, milk chocolate), etc.  The gift box is nice.  But at the current price (twenty-five dollars) it's just not very economical, especially when you check out other options.  If this were Scharffen Berger or Guittard quality, it might be worth the extra cost.  But for Hershey's?  You be the judge.  Only you know if it's worth it to you.  I'll pass.",

Not crunchy, not \"soft\"; imagine \"whipping\" melted chocolate so that the consistency is similar to whipped cream, then letting it harden into a chocolate bar shape.<br /><br />It melts the same as regular Hershey's milk chocolate (bar, kiss, whatever).  The best thing about these is that you feel like you're getting more per serving, since the bars are about 1/2\" thick, but the same width and length as a regular bar.  Granted, that extra space is just air, but the overall feeling is that you're getting a larger serving for the same dietary damage.<br /><br />I liked these OK -- not sure I'll purchase again, but definitely wanted to try them at least once.",

He settled on opening a tent-store in Stockton, CA, selling various supplies and confections to fellow miners. With his new business proving successful, Domingo decided to open a store and hotel in San Francisco. After a major fire in 1851 destroyed his businesses, he began to rebuild. In 1852, he formed a new confectionery company that would soon become the Ghirardelli Chocolate Company. Domingo would be proud to see how his chocolate company has not only grown, but flourished over the years. It started as a dream in the mid-1800s and it is now a thriving company and a leading brand of premium chocolate."

There's a perfect balance of chocolate to caramel to nuts, too. Other similar products tend to have too much of one component or another -- usually too much chocolate -- so we try to purchase these when we can find them.<br /><br />Amazon's price is not bad -- these tend to run six or seven dollars per box IF I can find them at all locally.<br /><br />I may buy a few boxes to tuck away in the freezer to have on hand for later in the year.",

He settled on opening a tent-store in Stockton, CA, selling various supplies and confections to fellow miners. With his new business proving successful, Domingo decided to open a store and hotel in San Francisco. After a major fire in 1851 destroyed his businesses, he began to rebuild. In 1852, he formed a new confectionery company that would soon become the Ghirardelli Chocolate Company. Domingo would be proud to see how his chocolate company has not only grown, but flourished over the years. It started as a dream in the mid-1800s and it is now a thriving company and a leading brand of premium chocolate."

The jug is large, and needs to be refrigerated after opening, so make sure you have room.<br />I froze oat milk in an ice tray to make milk cubes. Then, added them to my Ninja blender, along with this syrup, and a little silk creamer.<br />It makes some pretty good strawberries and cream milkshakes. We did end up adding a bit of monk fruit to them to give them a bit more sweetness.<br />This syrup has a nice flavor that is not exactly like fresh strawberries, but is a good substitute in many yummy drinks and other treats. We will have this gone in short order, as everyone loved the milkshakes. We will try icees next.<br />If you need a lot of strawberry syrup that is not concentrated, I would recommend giving this one a try.",

Now that I'm starting to use them not only for coffee but for snow cones and sodas, I need more flavors and more pumps. Two pumps out of this 6 pack of Alpha Pantry Gold Coffee Syrup Pumps for 750 ml Bottles have been added to the two newest flavors of my yummy syrups. They fit perfectly, are much easier than pouring from the big bottles, and it keeps my coffee and drink bar neat and tidy.

Rinaldo and ezilda torre blended their first torani Italian syrups using authentic recipes brought from Lucca, Italy. The enterprising couple shared their naturally flavored syrups throughout their north beach neighborhood. Mixing their rich torani syrups with sparkling water and ice, they introduced the classic Italian sodas to cafe owners. This bright, refreshing creation quickly caught on with thirsty customers. In time, torani' s reputation for creating syrups of the highest quality and greatest variety grew. Today, torani is the best-selling specialty syrup in north America and a sign of good taste around the world. What began as five traditional Italian flavors has expanded to more than 80 naturally flavored syrups and a host of creative flavoring ingredients. Each torani product is still made using only the finest ingredients and a careful blend of all-natural extracts. For the finest ingredients and beverage creativity, reach for torani."

It is, of course, very sweet, made with Non-GMO Cane Sugar. Yay! I am not restricted and would rather have sugar, than a sweetener and aftertaste.<br />The flavor is very close to that of my favorite name brand, and I guess for a single bottle, the price is comparable. I love my flavored coffees so much that I buy my favorite flavors in packs of 4, to save money, and because they last longer.<br />This Caramel Syrup would definitely be a contender if sold in 4 packs at a comparable price to my regular brand. It is a very yummy caramel syrup and I would absolutely recommend it!",

It's hard to describe. It is okay for sweetening coffee and adding a tiny bit of flavor. I added a few drops of Vanilla Flavoring along with it, and it kicks it up a notch.

They are a little different from Sucrose, but I like the sweetness they give. They don't have the after taste that Stevia has and I like that.<br />This flavor works great in my frozen yogurt and collagen powder smoothie bowls. I add a little of the syrup, along with some frozen Pineapple, shaved coconut and almonds, and blend away in my Ninja Smoothie Bowl blender attachment. It turns out so yummy! Of course, it also makes great snow cones, too. The grandkids loved having one over the weekend.<br />I think this is a great tasting and very versatile syrup.

I can't have just plain coffee, I always make flavored coffee and this Himalayan Sea Salt Caramel Flavoring just takes it up to a whole other level of yummy! I also appreciate that it's made with real sugar and all natural ingredients.<br />Though I love the glass bottle and I will be reusing it when empty, it is a bit hard to pour into your coffee or a spoon. A little runs down the side of the bottle every time I use it, needlessly wasting the precious liquid yumminess. An included pump would've been nice to prevent this.<br />Also, as another reviewer noted, there is Himalayan Salt in the syrup, but no nutrient value for Sodium listed on the label. It seems that the company may use the same label for all the syrup flavors, but Sodium content is a very important bit of missing information.<br />I love this flavored syrup in my coffee! Aside from my couple of irks from above, the taste is flavorful and authentic, without any chemical or artificial sweetener taste. That is because it is all natural, and I really love that. It also comes beautifully packaged and gift ready. Hopefully, they will correct the label, and maybe think of including a pump. Even so, I would still absolutely recommend this Flavored Syrup.",

Keemun is a small leaf tea from the Qimen county of Anhui province, best known as the main ingredient for English Breakfast blends. Although there is a whole universe of rose varieties and flavors, we believe the ideal petals for combining with Keemun come from the red roses native to Qimen county. They have a distinct sweet, cooling aroma that lends great balance to the blend. Rose Petal Black pairs well with rich and slightly spicy foods. It also makes a delicious iced tea. One of our favorite recipes is to prepare a sauce from Rose Petal Black and serve it over vanilla ice cream."

                            "Blended in late summer when the roses are in full bloom and at their most fragrant, Rose Petal Black, also known as \u2018Meigui Hong Cha\u2019, combines rich Keemun tea and red rose petals. Keemun is a small leaf tea from the Qimen county of Anhui province, best known as the main ingredient for English Breakfast blends. Although there is a whole universe of rose varieties and flavors, we believe the ideal petals for combining with Keemun come from the red roses native to Qimen county. They have a distinct sweet, cooling aroma that lends great balance to the blend. Rose Petal Black pairs well with rich and slightly spicy foods. It also makes a delicious iced tea. One of our favorite recipes is to prepare a sauce from Rose Petal Black and serve it over vanilla ice cream."

                            "The Bigelow Tea Story Beginning the moment our founder, Ruth Campbell Bigelow created \"Constant Comment\" Tea in her kitchen in 1945, our family has focused on just one thing trying to make the finest teas possible. Over the years we have introduced many new flavors as well as concepts in tea. Today we offer a selection of deliciously different blends of teas and green teas, a wide variety of herbal teas and teas flavored with real fruit juice. Today Bigelow Tea is the number one specialty tea company in the United States. And to think it all began with the first legendary black tea flavored with golden orange rind and sweet spice \"Constant Comment\"Tea. Bigelow takes immense pride in providing the tea drinking community with the best tea at a great value. We only use hand- picked teas, real spices, flavors and herbs. The flavors and blends we have created are second to none. Some of our teas contain up to twenty different ingredients! And because tea is a leaf that can dry out we take steps to protect it. To keep the teas fresh, we seal our tea bags in protective packets. We simply have to protect those delightful flavors. That's why a cup of Bigelow Tea is aromatic and delicious; a true indulgence for the senses."

Overall, it was not a good flavor in my opinion - which is personal opinion. I try not to rate on personal opinion. However, the envelopes were not well sealed and the powder was loose in the box - which I do rate on. The envelopes are inside of box - the envelopes themselves are apparently not sealing in production, don't look tampered with.  There was a significant amount of powder in the bottom of the soup box.  I will not purchasing again due to not liking the flavor, but the unsealed envelopes would be the main reason I would not purchase again.

It's a rich chicken bone broth with a light ginger add to the flavor - it's the perfect balance for my tastes - but everyone likes something different!  Bottom line is I like the flavor - and the protein punch of a tasty bone broth.  Pacific Foods offers the best taste and best quality version in my opinion.<br />UPDATE:  10/09/2021  Sad to say that I got the wrong soup and it is really a hassle to return it for refund.  Looking for a new outlet.  The broth is 5 star - but I only like the chicken ginger - NOT the salt free plain chicken.  Eh.  If they didn't have the right flavor, they should not have just randomly decided I might like the salt free plain chicken. Uh - NO. Now I have to arrange a return.  All a waste of my time.<br />UPDATE:  10/10/21..  I did receive a full refund and will donate the wrong item sent to the food bank.  While the Pacific Foods product is a 5 star product, I will be seeking other outlets.  I do appreciate the refund as this was not my fault in any way.",

                            "siggi's\u00ae Icelandic Strained Whole Milk Yogurt is an ode to deeply rooted Scandinavian dairy tradition that has been a part of Icelandic culture for centuries. siggi's\u00ae founder wasn't thrilled with the overly sweet and artificial taste of other US yogurt brands, inspiring him to create thoughtfully simple yogurt sourced with milk from family farms. And speaking of milk, each cup of siggi's\u00ae yogurt uses 4x the amount of milk than a regular cup of yogurt \u2013 making it rich in protein without all the sugar. siggi's\u00ae yogurt is thick and creamy \u2013 ideal as an addition to breakfast, a nutritious snack, or an afternoon pick-me-up. Pair with your favorite toppings, like fresh berries and granola, or enjoy as is. Our strawberry & rhubarb whole milk yogurt contains only 7 simple ingredients without all those dreadful artificial sweeteners."

This was the first gum ball created where the color actually IS the same as the flavor. Each gumball is complete with a thin hard candy shell and a hollow center. The fabulous gumballs proved that blowing bubbles doesn\u2019t need to be pink. So much has changed since the first Ferrara candy rolled off the line and into stores in 1908. But the same creativity and innovation that fed those early years remains at the heart of our company. In fact, it\u2019s what has made us the number one non chocolate candy manufacturer in the U.S. We\u2019ve got a sweet history \u2014 but an even richer opportunity for future growth and success is right at our doorstep. Our mission is to take the brands that have been loved for generations to the next level. In 2012, we brought together brands like Trolli, Brach\u2019s, Black Forest, Now & Later and Lemonhead. We\u2019re continuously innovating to bring the best tasting, highest quality confections to the marketplace."

This was the first gum ball created where the color actually IS the same as the flavor. Each gumball is complete with a thin hard candy shell and a hollow center. The fabulous gumballs proved that blowing bubbles doesn\u2019t need to be pink. So much has changed since the first Ferrara candy rolled off the line and into stores in 1908. But the same creativity and innovation that fed those early years remains at the heart of our company. In fact, it\u2019s what has made us the number one non chocolate candy manufacturer in the U.S. We\u2019ve got a sweet history \u2014 but an even richer opportunity for future growth and success is right at our doorstep.

We also wanted a snack we felt good about feeding them. Hugely flavorful snacks made with real, simple ingredients -- you know, ingredients you don\u2019t have to scrunch up your face to say. Snacks packed with positivity, not guilt. Snacks that keep the joy in everyday snacking (and snacking and snacking\u2026). With bright bags that radiate all the love and fun that went into them from the beginning. After all, isn\u2019t that what snacking should be about? We couldn\u2019t agree more. Enjoy.

We also wanted a snack we felt good about feeding them. Hugely flavorful snacks made with real, simple ingredients -- you know, ingredients you don\u2019t have to scrunch up your face to say. Snacks packed with positivity, not guilt. Snacks that keep the joy in everyday snacking (and snacking and snacking\u2026). With bright bags that radiate all the love and fun that went into them from the beginning. After all, isn\u2019t that what snacking should be about? We couldn\u2019t agree more. Enjoy. XO, Angie Always simple. Always real. 100% awesome. Perfectly sea-salted, this otherwise classic popcorn clocks in at a mind-boggling 35 calories per cup. This 9 oz family sized-offering featuring a resealable zip top is big enough to share, but we won\u2019t tell if you don\u2019t. From your lunch tote to a wine-filled romcom night with the girls, you\u2019re about to get snack-cessful up in here.",

It was heavy on buttery topping and other artificial flavors. Our fans asked us for something with less topping, but with that same great taste, and we came up with SkinnyPop \u2013 skinny on ingredients! We don\u2019t think anyone should feel guilty about snacking on our products. Popcorn is a whole grain food \u2013 it contains the entire kernel. Because of this, it is high in fiber, rich in nutrients and has a low glycemic index. There is \u201cno artificial anything\u201d in our products \u2013 meaning we do not add any artificial or synthetic ingredients, colors, flavors, or preservatives to them. No Artificial Anything and still DELICIOUS."

Just because of a stamp one can not improve the quality of their product. This is just a cold pressed VCO without the high quality standards of what FT VCO happens to be. Read the labelling carefully.<br /><br />Nutiva has posted the following on their Website; &#34;&#34;Please note that there is no difference between Virgin and Extra-Virgin Coconut Oil. We previously called our coconut oil &#34;extra-virgin&#34; to emphasize our commitment to quality, however as we move into international markets we have removed the term to comply with international regulations that disallow the term. Be assured that our product quality has not changed in any way. For more information on this click here.&#34;&#34; There is a difference, it is illegal to claim virgin in few places in the world since virgin is only a definition used for olive oil, not for any other oil. Many producers were using virgin but due to competition of so many producers of VCO pupping everywhere in Asia, many are regrouping for better sales. This is the same as non-FT VCO but at a higher pricing.<br /><br />I use VCO in the mix for my hair, shaving cream, soap, hand lotion, face lotion, body lotion, tooth paste as well as I make popcorn and consume it straight out of the jar for its nutrients. Years ago, I was able to get raw, hand pressed coconut oils from fresh coconuts from Mexico produced right here in US but due to popularity of VCOs, many producers have been creative in making money by misleading shoppers as well as many misleading reviews by shoppers certainly has hyped the business of VCO to another level. Extra Virgin Coconut Oil is a lie since Extra Virgin applies only to olive oil and infact the VCO market has become so saturated that many producers are removing extra from their labeling and calling it virgin coconut oil, no more extra virgin. In Canada where the best VCOs are produced, it is illegal to even use the term, extra virgin for coconut oil but in US the laws are very relaxed. There is no Extra Virgin coconut oil, only virgin, there is no pure, no #1, no 100%, no premium liquid, or any of those terms used for coconut oils. There is no coconut oil especially produced for beauty product which is any different than for cooking or consumption either as a salad dressing or right out of the jar with a spoon.

This is your average VCO, nothing special so all the misleading info in regard to hexane free VCO is provided by entities that want to promote this product. If you want hexane free then you need to pay much more and go with specialty not mass producer VCO like NUTIVA that misleads all the time. Few years ago NUTIVA sold this VCO under VIRGIN labeling and now that they don't since VCO has become too popular with many producers so NUTIVA has removed the misleading label from its product.<br /><br />I changed my review from three star to one star since the top reviewers on this item are misleading shoppers by claiming such statements that are not true at all like &#34;&#34;&#34;According to Nutiva, no hexane is used in the processing of this oil. Hexane is a petroleum-derived solvent used in all kinds of industrial applications, from shoe manufacturing to roofing. Interestingly, because hexane's primary molecular structure is carbon, it can be passed off as &#34;organic.&#34; Do a little research; &#34;cold-pressed,&#34; &#34;organic,&#34; AND &#34;hexane-free&#34; are key considerations when selecting your coconut oil for nutrition purposes.&#34;&#34;&#34; This is the same VCO that is sold by all other producers except the real quality VCO producers where they use hand press which costs more. The same VCO that is sold in the big box store for four a pound is the same as this. All you need to do is read their supplier and you will see that all Asian countries are supplying their coconut for this brand as well as all other VCO brands except the brand that are hand pressed. This is a brand that used to claim EXTRA few years ago, now they have removed that word for marketing reasons. This is not the highest nutrient VCO since it has hexane just like all other commercial grad VCOs.<br /><br />Nutiva is changing is labeling since all their containers were labelled EXTRA VIRGIN and now they are not. The top reviewer is misleading shoppers by claims &#34;&#34;&#34;According to Nutiva, no hexane is used in the processing of this oil. Hexane is a petroleum-derived solvent used in all kinds of industrial applications, from shoe manufacturing to roofing.

Those are lies since cold press requires hexane. If it was not hexane, then the producer would specify the hexane-free. Always do your research before purchase.<br /><br />I use VCO in the mix for my hair, shaving cream, soap, hand lotion, face lotion, body lotion, tooth paste as well as I make popcorn and consume it straight out of the jar for its nutrients. Years ago, I was able to get raw, hand pressed coconut oils from fresh coconuts from Mexico produced right here in US but due to popularity of VCOs, many producers have been creative in making money by misleading shoppers as well as many misleading reviews by shoppers certainly has hyped the business of VCO to another level.

When heated, just like any food item, VCO loses its nutritional value. As a beauty product, I mix this VCO with CO since CO is one of my favorite oils for my skin and it keeps the VCO in liquid form instead of solid form regardless of the temperature. Not Fair Trade but at an excellent VCO at $.31 an ounce in 74oz containers not at $.54 an ounce in 128oz containers. Extra is a lie so Nutiva is changing its labelling to VCO, no more EVCO and furthermore introducing Fair Trade which is not sold on Amazon.",

Those reviews of horror stories, not only about this item but in general are nothing but lies especially when one is claiming that they purchased not one but four jars from WF and all were rancid and defective. I purchase from WF for freshness but I keep it in refrigerator and consume it in reasonable amount of time since I consume food for the nutrients and freshness is the only way to get nutrients.",

Spectrum is an organic producer which sells refined as well as unrefined EVCO in many different labellings, different containers, glass to plastic. Not a Fair Trade EVCO but one of only handful of producers that does not claim Extra Virgin anywhere on their labelling at all since there is no Extra Virgin EVCO anywhere sold in US when majority of others producers try to sell it as EVCO and use EVCO as a marketing tool. This is a GRADE C mix.<br /><br />REGULATIONS: It's important to note that, while Europe has rigorous standards in place for the terminology of cold pressing (fully unrefined oil extracted at temperatures below 122 degrees F), the phrase 'cold pressed' has been used erroneously in the U.S. for a number of years, often employed as a marketing technique for oils which have been expeller pressed or even refined (which exposes the oil to temperatures of up to 470 degrees F).<br /><br />COOKING: Since coconut oil is heat stable, it can be baked into desserts, and substituted for EVOO or vegetable oil. I will never give up cooking with EVOO, since to me EVOO is the best oil. I cook with EVOO not EVCO but for my popcorns, I go with EVCO.<br /><br />SKIN: EVCO is massage oil, so is almond oil. Almond oil is the best skin conditioner. EVCO and almond+castor oil are the best for all my scabs when mountain biking since it keeps the skin soft and moist which does not allow it to dry which becomes very compelling to scratch and remove the scab which is a no, no.<br /><br />FACE: After shaving, lotion is always better than cream since lotion is lighter than cream and does not block hair pores so I always apply EVCO on my skin. With that said, I never apply any EVCO above my lower eyelids especially when wearing contact lenses or doing sports since EVCO can be very disturbing and damaging to the eyes and the contact lenses especially when applied on forehead regardless if I am sweating or not. EVCO is the best cream for my lips instead of those chemicals sold as a lip balm.<br /><br />HAIR: leave-in conditioner, I place it on my hair before I head out to the beach for surfing. No need to use shampoo to remove EVCO, ocean salt removes EVCO.<br /><br />SUNSCREEN: I mix EVOO and EVCO in a bowl, place the bowl in a hot water, blend the mix, add non-nano zinc oxide powder and then let it cool. Few minutes later, I add few drops of almond oil and wheat germ oil. Blend the mix, pour in small containers and place it in refrigerator. I insure that I choose the best ingredients that I am familiar with.<br /><br />SCRUB: I blend few different oils and spices together to get the right mix for my skin. I blend EVCO, EVOO, avocado, raw honey, turmeric, coffee, germ wheat oil, almond oil, castor oil and ginger. Avocado and germ wheat oils high in vitamin E soften skin, castor oil removes black spots on the skin, EVOO is a hydrator and antioxidant, EVCO and raw honey are antibacterial, coffee exfoliates and tightens loose skin, turmeric reduces inflammation and ginger fight illness. I mix and add few drops of cold boiled water as needed a drop at a time till the mix forms a paste. I spread the mix over my skin and rub. I let it dry and rinse off in the shower. Afterward I apply almond, EVOO and EVCO.<br /><br />SHAVING CREAM: Grate half of a soap bar, add EVOO and castor oil, add distilled water, mix well, apply low heat, stir till water evaporates, add EVCO, pour mix in a small container with a cap for a day for the best home made organic shaving cream with USDA organic ingredients.<br /><br />TOOTHPASTE: Scientists tested coconut oil against Streptococcus mutans - a sugar-loving bacterium that clings to teeth and produces acid causing them to rot. When the oil was treated with digestive enzymes it became a powerful killer of the bug. I make sure to rub some on my gums and teeth before going to bed since that is when bacteria in mouth increases.",

It is produced using the same methods farmers have used for centuries. Meat from only the freshest, organically grown coconuts is shredded and cold-pressed to create coconut milk, then filtered and separated to extract only the highest quality oil.\" Let's look at some facts... All EVCO are cold Pressed and Extra Virgin but there is no Extra Virgin Coconut Oil. Not a Fair Trade VCO either. Does not provide its labelling images from all sides either. It is not raw either since it is heated.<br /><br />COOKING: Since coconut oil is heat stable, it can be baked into desserts, and substituted for EVOO or vegetable oil. I will never give up cooking with EVOO, since to me EVOO is the best oil. I cook with EVOO not EVCO but for my popcorns, I go with EVCO.<br /><br />SKIN: EVCO is massage oil, so is almond oil. Almond oil is the best skin conditioner. EVCO and almond+castor oil are the best for all my scabs when mountain biking since it keeps the skin soft and moist which does not allow it to dry which becomes very compelling to scratch and remove the scab which is a no, no.<br /><br />FACE: After shaving, lotion is always better than cream since lotion is lighter than cream and does not block hair pores so I always apply EVCO on my skin. With that said, I never apply any EVCO above my lower eyelids especially when wearing contact lenses or doing sports since EVCO can be very disturbing and damaging to the eyes and the contact lenses especially when applied on forehead regardless if I am sweating or not. EVCO is the best cream for my lips instead of those chemicals sold as a lip balm.<br /><br />HAIR: leave-in conditioner, I place it on my hair before I head out to the beach for surfing. No need to use shampoo to remove EVCO, ocean salt removes EVCO.<br /><br />TOOTHPASTE: Scientists tested coconut oil against Streptococcus mutans - a sugar-loving bacterium that clings to teeth and produces acid causing them to rot. When the oil was treated with digestive enzymes it became a powerful killer of the bug. I make sure to rub some on my gums and teeth before going to bed since that is when bacteria in mouth increases.",

To make Trader Joe's Organic Virgin Coconut Oil, starts with freshly harvested coconuts that are de-husked and grated. The meat of the coconut is dried to remove the water, and then it's cold pressed and filtered to remove any remaining pieces of the fruit. That's the process. Nothing more. By producing the oil in this way, the nutrients, flavor characteristics and aromas of fresh coconuts are retained. Use Organic Virgin Coconut Oil in cooking - it stands up to relatively high heat and imparts a distinctive flavor - in salad dressings, for baking, and even as a moisturizer for dry skin. It's true! It will fluctuate from a liquid to a solid state, depending on the temperature at which it's stored, so don't be surprised when the solid-looking oil you bought in the store turns into a liquid when the jar's been stored in a warmer pantry."

Nutiva is changing its labelling so no more extra virgin as well as producing it Fair Trade since VCO market is becoming so saturated with low quality VCO and marketing lies.",

Zoa just has such an off smell when opening the can..and it tastes way to herbal. I won't order again as my initial perception hasn't changed.

                            "Historic Lynchburg Tennessee Whiskey Apple Cinnamon Barbecue Sauce (16 FL.OZ. / 454 g): This family recipe was created around the turn of the century, almost five generations ago. The old folks wanted a distinctive flavor and realized that local Tennessee Whiskey was the answer. The family is proud of their delicious barbecue sauce and they are committed to providing the finest traditional old time quality barbecue sauce available. We recommend that our sauce be basted on the last 5 to 10 minutes of cooking time to allow the flavor to penetrate the meat and then serve, well browned, right off the grill. Ingredients: Tomato Concentrate, Apples, Molasses, Brown Sugar, Sugar, Honey, Pineapple, Soy Sauce, Apple Juice, Worcestershire, Spices, Onions, Garlic, Ginger, Cinnamon, Natural Flavors, Jack Daniel's Whiskey, Sodium Benzoate"

It is a decent, journeyman oil with a bright grassy green flavor--almost chartreuse! Greek oils are my favorites because of the taste and higher polyphenols. This one I would likely use for cooking rather than finishing, when a subtler and more complex flavor is preferred that does not overpower or distract from foods. Secondarily, the pour spout produces a thin trickle of oil, rather than a smooth stream; it can take a bit of time to measure out a tablespoon or two. The bottle is beautiful, dark glass with art images. The price is reasonable for an imported Greek oil. All things considered, not sure if I will purchase again.",

However, the oil finally arrived. The bottle makes a beautiful presentation; it is heavy, dark green glass. The stopper top is crafted to \"look like\" wood with a cork bottom, but is more likely a synthetic material formed to appear like a high-end wood top with a cork stopper. This is an odd choice for an organic, small batch oil. Pouring the oil requires care as the final drops of oil slide over the lip of the top and must be carefully cleaned off. As for the oil? It is adequate. It is light, with no after taste or bitterness, and thus works well as a finishing oil that will not clash with a passable balsamic vinegar, mixed with butter, or used alone. It has no distinguishing notes. I think that the price is steep, all things considered.",

                            "For a smoothly sweet flavor, chefs have been turning to butterscotch for decades. This sweet treat is made by combining just the right amount of melted brown sugar, butter and other ingredients. The mixture is traditionally allowed to harden into butterscotch candy and broken into pieces to enjoy, or it can be distilled into butterscotch extract that can be used in coffee, cocktails, and various food recipes. OliveNation\u00e2\u20acs Butterscotch Extract provides a rich butterscotch flavor using only the best ingredients. Our butterscotch extract utilizes the freshest unsalted butter, cane brown sugar, and other ingredients that are painstakingly distilled at optimum temperature to create a gourmet delight. The essence of butter and brown sugar, our butterscotch extract is a main ingredient in desserts, candies, and baked goods. It is even used to flavor liquors for designer cocktails and specialty drinks. While butterscotch extract is essential to some popular recipes, there are an endless variety of ways that the butterscotch extract can be used. Mix some of our butterscotch extract into your morning coffee for a special treat, or add it to brownie recipes for moist, sweet brownies that everyone will love."

I am am a label reader, but I guess this time I was not. I assumed being Plant Based as I am Vegetarian it would have healthy ingredients. Taste was great, I love spicy food, but the Fat , Carbohydrates and Sodium were very high. I eat many things from this brand so was somewhat disappointed . I doubt I will buy again as it does not work for me. If those things don't bother you then go for it. Price was comparable to other frozen meals similar.",

I ignored the email & forgot about it for a long while with the holidays & all that. Finally I figured what the heck, why not? They claimed that they improved the tea. I had my doubts. But hey, they want to send me new improved organic matcha, I'm game.<br /><br />What do you know? It IS better! Color me surprised. For matcha from China this new box they sent is surprisingly good. I would have updated this to four stars, but they asked me to change my review once I told them the tea was better. Nothing super wrong with that, but it did irritate me a little. Maybe I'm a turd. I don't know.<br /><br />To be clear true matcha is from Japan & they (Japan) have some amazing matcha & some awful matcha (they also have stricter/cleaner growing methods). Usually matcha from China is nasty. This was nasty. Now it's not. Maybe they improved how they grow it &/or how they harvest it.<br /><br />If you decide to try this & don't like it. You might want to contact the seller. They really do seem to want to have a good reputation & happy customers. After all, they didn't ask for a review change until I said that the tea was better than their previous tea.<br /><br />Unlike the tea in the original review below, I am actually drinking this. I had to throw out the original tea it was so disgustingly bad.<br /><br />Original 1 Star Review:<br />Bitter, Astringent Matcha From China<br />Reviewed in the United States \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 on October 13, 2022:<br /><br />I've been drinking organic ceremonial matcha tea for about a decade. To this day, I will always be grateful that I didn't cheap out with some sort of low end culinary grade. If I had, I may have never drank another cuppa matcha again.<br /><br />This is \"ceremonial\" matcha from China. I should have known better. The powder has a nice color but that's all it has going for it. It is bitter & astringent with zero sweetness. I couldn't even finish one cup. It also doesn't mix well, leaving a lot of sludge at the bottom. A true organic Japanese ceremonial grade matcha requires nothing more than hot water. It is naturally sweet with no bitterness.

As a physician, I\u2019ve realized just how important this superfood is. The EGCG in Matcha is one of the most potent antioxidants we can put in our bodies and supports the immune system. It makes changes at the cellular level (in the DNA) that protects us against genetic changes related to aging. I wanted to find a source that was the most nutrient dense on the planet, and one that I could give to patients. I was looking for the highest EGCG and Theanine content of any matcha source-and I found it in Japan at the base of volcano. It is harvested only once per year to get the maximum amount of nutrients out of the soil, and shade grown by master Japanese growers who are generational in their ceremonial matcha growing skills. This is the actual grade the samurai\u2019s took before going into battle. This is what I use with patients. It\u2019s the best, I promise."

Served in tea ceremonies and on its own, this vibrant green tea powder comes from leaves grown only within the Kyoto prefecture -- renowned as the birthplace of Japanese tea.  Ranked amongst the most quintessentially sought after Japanese products, our super premium culinary grade Uji Matcha has a rich fragrance, vibrant green color, smooth texture, and delicate aftertaste. You can enjoy our Uji Matcha on its own or in other high-quality culinary creations. Our 100% USDA Organic Matcha green tea powders are premium ceremonial grade teas that are perfect for the traditional Japanese Matcha Tea experience. Our Organic Matcha is grown without pesticides or harmful fertilizers, harvested by hand and stone ground to preserve its nutritional qualities.  A little history about Matcha: Matcha is a finely ground green tea powder that has been used for centuries in Japan as a ceremonial beverage. It has become an increasingly popular drink around the world due to its health benefits and energizing effects. However, much like fine wine, matcha can come in many different grades and quality levels so it's important to understand what you're actually buying before making your purchase. At the upper tier, Ceremonial grade matcha is the highest quality available and will typically have very fine particles with a deep green color (sometimes called \"jade\"). Ceremonial grade tea has been traditionally used for centuries by Zen priests and legend has it that it was used to promote spiritual awakening."

It's perfect.<br /><br />I've been drinking USDA/JAS Certified Organic Ceremonial grade matcha for a little over a decade. I've had a lot of types. The low end stuff that really has no business calling itself ceremonial can usually be consumed if enough sweetener is added. Basically, a latte. The good stuff, like this brand, requires nothing. It stands on it's own.<br /><br />If you've never had matcha or have only had culinary grade & as a result claim you don't like matcha, I don't blame you. Culinary is garbage. It's a dull dark green without a hint of sweetness & plenty bitter. Don't be put off by the tiny canisters of ceremonial grade matcha. It doesn't seem like much for the price, but depending on how many cuppas you enjoy per day, one canister could last you a month (1 cuppa per day). Don't boil the water. You want hot water, not boiling. This isn't black tea. Green tea is ruined by boiling water. Make sure your matcha is from Japan. Heck, make sure all of your tea is from Japan. Tea from Japan has the least amount of heavy metals. Last, look up how to drink ceremonial matcha so you can enjoy it properly.",

If it was priced lower I'd say it's not bad for what you get, but I get better, sweeter, & smoother tasting certified organic ceremonial grade matcha for less that this. This is not a good price for what you get.<br /><br />If you've never had matcha, don't get this. Too many people get cheaper culinary grade for their first try & then declare that they hate matcha. I'd hate it too if that's what I drank. Culinary can work in overly sweetened lattes, but for a true cuppa quality matcha, spend the extra money & get ceremonial grade. DoMatcha, Pantenger, & Kenko are all organic affordable options with good flavor to get you started.<br /><br />I wont go so far to call this matcha culinary grade, but it most definitely is not ceremonial. It requires a bit more sugar to make the flavor more palatable. It's not terrible, but there are much better teas available. I don't regret getting this, but I doubt I'd get it again.",

It arrived in a glass amber jar which is nice. No inner foil packet or seal on the jar, just the loose powder. The color was green, but not vibrant. Not too bad though. I still had high hopes. Once I made a cup I started to become concerned as the color wasn't the beautiful bright green I'm accustomed to. Then comes the taste. It's terrible. I could have tolerated it if it wasn't for the very unpleasant aftertaste that clung to my tongue. I've never had a matcha cling to my taste buds like this. I can't even say the taste was bitter, it was just very unpleasant. Very off putting. The smell wasn't a sweet grassy fragrance. I just can't describe it properly. It doesn't smell like matcha. This seems more like culinary grade which I never intentionally buy because the culinary stuff is just awful.",

                    "user_review": "I've been drinking organic ceremonial matcha for many years. I realize it has become popular of late, so now there are a lot of matcha options out there.  You can get Chinese ceremonial matcha or traditional Japanese ceremonial matcha.  I prefer to get authentic organic ceremonial Japanese matcha & as a rule, try my best to avoid Chinese matcha.<br /><br />When I ordered this, there was no mention of where the tea is from.  Only that it is certified organic ceremonial matcha.  When it arrived, I discovered it's from China.  For this reason alone I took off a star.<br /><br />The matcha is surprisingly good.  Better than a lot of so-called ceremonial matchas on the market.  It is not bitter.  It is a nice bright green.  Not a dirty green, dull green, or brownish green.  It is a beautiful bright green.  The flavor is very good.  It also mixes well.  If it wasn't from China, it would be darn near perfect.<br /><br />If you are new to matcha, pay attention.  You can get two types, ceremonial or culinary (& as mentioned above they can come from China or Japan).  If you just want to enjoy a nice cuppa, get ceremonial.  If you want to put it in a smoothie or use it in baking, you can get the cheap culinary grade if you want.  Culinary is never as bright a green & it never tastes as sweet & smooth as ceremonial.  Culinary is also much more bitter.  You will also want to prepare your ceremonial matcha properly.  You can order a matcha set which is a wonderful way to enjoy the tea (yes, I have my own matcha bowls, whisks, etc.) or you can use a regular tea mug.  The key is to add just a tiny bit of water to the powder to form a paste, then finish adding the water & whisk or stir.  If you do not make a paste first, it will never fully incorporate & you will get a lousy cuppa.  Also, never use boiling water.  It brings out bitterness & ruins the tea.  Hot water will do just fine.<br /><br />Overall, I am rather pleased by this Chinese matcha (I can't believe I'm saying that!).",

                            "Tips for consummation and storage",
                            "- Matcha should be kept away from heat, moisture, light and air exposure, it\u2019s suggested keeping it in your refrigerator and get it well-sealed.  - As a kind of green tea without any additive, matcha doesn\u2019t really \u201cexpire\u201d quickly but its taste will downgrade through time especially when not well stored, thus we recommend consuming it within 2 - 3 months since the first opening. When outdated, you can still use it for bakery.  - Overheating will damage the chlorophyll in matcha and make the beverage yellow, it is not suggested to consume this ceremonial matcha with boiling water, enjoy it with water of 158 \u2109 ideally. - Matcha is milled premium tea leaves so they are not dissolvable, please whisk it and consume it before precipitating."

I don\u2019t feel run down anymore from working around the house and sweating a lot.  When you put them in the fridge they get really cold and they\u2019re so refreshing to drink.",

The mushrooms have been dried and extracted and, as with the coffee, are 100% organic. In each cup, you get 100mg of caffeine from the coffee beans. The mushrooms give you the extra energy and it also helps with your immune system. Your first taste may not be the best tasting coffee you have ever had, but it isn't bad. And you get the benefits of the mushrooms, which are densely packed with nutrients. Cordyceps are even used to make your kidneys stronger. All in all, definitely worth the try and as you continue to drink it, you will become accustomed. The mushroom is so mild, people can't even detect it and would never know unless you tell them.",

                        "Edible Art Decorative Paint by Sweet Sticks is revolutionary paint made in Australia. With a unique blend of 100-percent edible ingredients, they can paint, dry and be rub free on many surfaces, making cake decorating quicker, easier and more effective. These paints take away the need to mix luster and alcohol together, a method that most of the time makes a big mess and causes money loss. Simply shake, pour and paint. Paints on fondant, buttercream cakes (chilled), royal icing, sugar cookies, marshmallows, gold leaf, deco magic, confectionery, ganache, modeling chocolate and more. Sweet Sticks edible paint can be applied using many different techniques, including brushes for detailed work. The manufacturer recommends using a quality sable brush or sponge. Sponge work also looks great on buttercream, fondant and royal icing. The paint is ready to use from the bottle, so there is no need to thin it out or mix it with any other ingredients. Once applied, it dries quickly and the pigment is sealed within the surface \u2014 no dust or smudges. If you require a water color effect, you can achieve that by adding cake decorators alcohol (high grade 95-percent alcohol) to your palette. Keep away from children and store in a dry cool place. Do not consume in liquid form. Wash used brushes with hot, soapy water, paper towel or baby wipes. Getting started: shake well before and during use. Try different paint brushes. Some streak, some do not. Take the time and play with your paints. Become familiar with them. Mix and match your own colors if you like. Why you are going to love it: Once dry, the paints are rub free. No fuss. The color is true. What you see is what you get. 100-percent food grade. Free of gluten, dairy and peanuts. A little bottle goes a long way."

                            "We have developed a unique form of color and packaging for our products. To provide greater efficiency, quality, value and convenience for the decorator we created Soft Gel Paste\u2122, a pourable, highly concentrated gel, breaking with the industry standard of a hard paste in a jar. We purposefully chose a bottle that looked different from anything else on the market\u2014a squeezable bottle with a flip-top cap. This allows color to be dispensed in individual drops for clean and easy to repeat control from one application to the next. These highly concentrated soft gel food colors are formulated with the necessary die concentration levels needed to achieve the most vibrant and brilliant shades. Soft Gel Paste colors have a viscosity that offers the convenience of a pour-able gel, making it easier to measure amounts or duplicate shades. Only a small amount is needed to tint icing, fondant, marzipan, gum paste, or dough without affecting the consistency, and it will not break down buttercream or non-dairy icings like liquid colors. Product made in the United States. Ingredients: Water, sugar, and one or more of the following U.S. certified colors: Blue 1 (E133), Blue 2 (E132), Yellow 5 (E102), Yellow 6 (E110), Red 3 (E127), Red 40 (E129), titanium dioxide (E171), mica pigment, vegetable gum, modified corn starch, citric acid and less than 1/10 of 1% sodium benzoate and potassium sorbate as preservatives. *Due to the calibration differences between computer monitors, tablets, etc., the color you see here may not exactly match the finished product."

You can also open the bottle and stir the mixture with the end of your paint brush before shaking. Shake the bottle each time before using the paint, including between sessions. If your paint is transparent, the ingredients haven\u2019t mixed together Tip 2. Play with your paints, become familiar with them. Each color has different pigmentation, so get a feel for each color. Edible surfaces are all different, so also paint on different painting surfaces; the metallic paints can be applied to fondant, crusted buttercream cakes (chilled), sugar cookies, marshmallows, confectionery, ganache, modeling chocolate, macarons and fruits. Do not use these metallic paints on Italian or Swiss meringue buttercream as these surfaces keep the paints from air-drying and leave them in liquid form. Tip 3. These Metallic Paints prefer wide, flat brushes with soft bristlesTip 4. Have hot soapy water and paper towels on hand. When done with one color, wash your brush gently and dry at once with a paper towel; you can also wash the brush with dishwashing liquid in your hand, then rinse with hot water",

I drink coconut water nearly every day and I love the taste of coconut, so why not? Well, it is weird. I assumed it would be, cause it's got whey protein. But it's not so horrible you couldn't develop a taste for it if you wanted to. I just drank it down hard and fast to get the protein hit until I could eat a meal. But, really, a bit on the icky side. I can only say: try it. We all have different tolerance levels for those weird protein drink effects.",

When the explosion of coconut water in tetrapaks and cans came about a few years back, it was a boon to me. I've tried so many brands I've lost track, but in the past few months, I've settled into a few faves-- Taste Nirvana and some raw version Whole Foods sells that totally tastes like it came out of a shell within minutes of purchase.<br /><br />I bought this because I thought it would be good to add potassium and minerals to smoothies and to have on hand for when I wanted coconut water but ran out of cans. (Subscribe and save is a monthly thing and Whole Foods charges more than I wanna pay for my fave brand.) Since it's organic, that's a big plus.<br /><br />Well, surprise. This is pretty darn pleasant.<br /><br />Mixes very nicely and easily, too. And you can CUSTOMIZE, which I think is the bonus of reconstituting it yourself. For a stronger flavor, add more. Simple.<br /><br /> I'm not aware of the origin of the coconuts, but the flavor reminds me of South American coconut water as opposed to the Thai/Asian. It's not that sweet and it's a little salty, saltier than the Thai-origin brands I've enjoyed. Saltyish like O.N.E. and VitaCoco, but actually nicer than both those. Reconstituted, this baby's better than some non-dehydrated brands. Imagine that! Surprised me, for sure.<br /><br />I'll definitely rebuy. This is a very handy thing to have in my pantry, cause I hate being out of coconut water.<br /><br />This goes on my list, another Navitas product that satisfied this customer.",

Have had it out of the shell (we are Caribbean folks), chilled, and from assorted canned and bottled types, with and without sugar. I've tried a host. Some brands I did not wish to revisit--VitaCoco is funky tasting to me. New Zico (bottle) sucks. Old Zico (tetrapak) used to be nice, but after an intolerable and underhanded experience with their marketers online, I refuse to buy them anymore. O.N.E. is fine, and my sister loves it. I've had Harvest Bay, Amy and Brian, Nature Factor, and some names I forgt. I prefer Taste Nirvana these days, when I can't get the fresh (ie, froms hell) or raw organic one that Whole Foods sometimes stocks.<br /><br />This was not good. Naked. Ugh. I was out and about, thirsty, and stopped into a Nutrition S'Mart to buy coconut water. This was the only brand they had that I hadn't tried, so I went for it. Ugh. Never again. I cannot recommend this to coconut water lovers.<br /><br />But, hey, I like to at least try other brands. You never know which one will rock your world.<br /><br />And, as they say, different strokes.

It really has a taste similar to fresh coconut water--as much as canned allows, I suppose--without being weirdly sweet (as A&B can be, especially the small cans) or weirdly salty (as VitaCoco can be) or just plain milky awful (like Zico in the bottle). My sister likes O.N.E. best, but I like this one. Sweeter, less salty than many I've tried.<br /><br />I've had the pulp and no pulp versions, and prefer this one. Just a bit stronger flavor.<br /><br />For now, I keep stocked with this and have a can nearly every day. If I didn't have to watch calories, I'd have two a day, no kidding.

So, I have several cases of the short cans I refuse to drink. Awful. But I went through the cases of the tall cans. Wonderful.<br /><br />I wondered if the inconsistencies would show up in the tall cans, and I did not reorder. THEN..this big sale and sub/save showed up. Tempted me. I ordered TWO cases of this one, with the pulp.<br /><br />WONDERFUL. I like it even better than the pulp-free (which is weird, as I normally avoid pulp-containing packaged coconut water). I even found myself enjoying chewing the bits of pulp.The flavor is NOT too sweet, very nicely coconutty, not at all sour or weirdly salty like the new Zico, nicer than ONE and VitaCoco.<br /><br />So, I feel free to order more now. Clearly, there is some issue with the smaller cans. I strongly recommend you avoid those like the plague. They taste nothing like coconut water. They taste like you dropped some generic sugar candy in water and let it dissolve. Really icky sweet and NOT AT ALL coconutty. (I have had fresh out of the shell coconut water since childhood, my family being from the Caribbean, and have tasted virtually every brand available locally and on Amazon, and I know coconuts vary according to region and even harvest areas etc. Coconut water IS variable, so I don't expect homogeneous flavor. I do expect it to be coconut water and not candy water (or corn cereal milk like new Zico)). So, yeah, avoid small cans. Amy & Brian really need to look into why that stuff is disgusting, cause it's ruining their reputation whenever someone tastes that horror.<br /><br />The Tall Cans: Yes, buy these. I've sampled out of four different cases sent to me, always good. The pulp-free was more sweet compared to the tetra pak CW's I've tried, and the higher carb count makes sense. I even emailed the A&B people about it, and they said it was due to the blend/selection of coconuts that theirs is sweeter with a higher carb count. I can see how the selection could do this. I like the sweeter flavor, personally, but always have with meals cause it is higher carbs. When I want to drink coconut water by itself--I choose a lower carb variety, like original Zico was or ONE in a smaller quantity than the 17.5 ounce can.<br /><br />Thumbs up. Refreshing, sweet, coconutty, lovely. I love, love, love this coconut water in the TALL CANS.<br /><br />But I beg the Amyy & Brian folks to investigate and revamp the processing for the smaller cans. That stuff is vile and I have two cases plus sitting in my kitchen that I cannot drink. (Add that to the Zico I can't stomach and preordered and that's a lot of my money going to waste cause companies can't get it right/screw with a tried-true formula).<br /><br />Happy sipping!",

                    "user_review": "Please see update at the end of this review. For fairness sake, I'm leaving original review I did when I tried the 17.5 oz cans intact. But the smaller cans do not contain the same quality product. Whether bad batch (one time) or just bad distributor/supplier for small cans (ongoing), I'd beware. Now, the original review, then the updates:<br /><br />This is far and away my fave coconut water now that I'm self-exiled from the horror that is new Zico (they ruined a terrific product by making it from concentrate).<br /><br />Note that this comes in cans, not tetra paks, and the cans are BPA-free. These are recyclable (well, as long as your area accepts cans.) Note as well that Amy & Brian's coconut waters are flash-pasteurized (like ONE and Zico and others). Unless you wanna risk crazy bacteria, coconut water must have some sort of pasteurization.<br /><br />I've been sampling various amazon-available coconut waters looking for my new staple. History:  I was a loyal Zico subscriber/drinker for a couple years. They changed. It's awful. I canceled my subscription. I've had and enjoyed O.N.E. in the tetra pak and Nature Factor's organic in a can. I've had and not liked as much VitaCoco and Harvest Bay. But all those are fine depending on your own taste preferences. Previously, I had also tried supermarket brands like Goya and Conchita. I'm always willing to try coconut water, looking for good price and great taste. I decided to try Amy & Brian's cause I learned about them from googling \"coconut water taste tests\" due to wanting to see what others thought of the brands out there. One taste test comparison mentioned this one tasted most like the actual coconut that was used in the taste test for comparison. Another taste test gave A&B props, too. So, yeah, got my attention.<br /><br />This one is now my new fave. I have subscribed to the A&B pulp free in both can sizes.<br /><br />Second fave based on flavor alone (not processing, container, etc) is Nature Factor's organic one. After that O.N.E. VitaCoco is good for those who prefer less sweetness, more of a slightly sourness. Something out there for everyone, right?<br /><br />I can say this to coconut water lovers: those above are definitely worth trying to see if you enjoy them, too, before you decide on a permanent subscription. But do try this one if you enjoy a bit more sweetness. So good. But if you hate any sort of higher sense of sweetness in your beverages, this isn't for you. I'd recommend ONE or Vitacoco for you, or maybe Harvest Bay.<br /><br />What makes this one a bit different than the good brands I've named:<br /><br />Big can option or small can option: 17.5 ounces vs this one that's 10 ouncnes. I buy both now, cause some days I want the bigger can to take with me to Pilates.<br /><br />Sweeter: Maybe it's where they get their coconuts from, but this brand has a delicious sweetness that is lacking on ONE, VitaCoco, Zico (old and new), and Harvest Bay. Nature Factor's is a bit sweeter than the previous, but Amy and Brian beats them all. I like sweet. :D Because another reviewer called it \"unnaturally sweet\", I emailed Amy & Brian via their website to ask if this is from concentrate or has sugar added or manipulated. I was told it's juice as it came from the coconuts, not from concentrate, no sugar added. So, I'm content.<br /><br />Some facts:<br /><br />8 oz = 76 calories<br />This is more than ounce per ounce for other brands, but this is probably explained by the sweetness (meaning more natural carbs). Worth noting for those who are on low-carb/carb-conscious diets. For the rest, it just means MORE FLAVOR.<br /><br />I wish Amy & Brian would put the potassium count on the label, though. This matters to a lot of us, including those who need to watch K intake due to drugs that spare potassium or folks who have high blood pressure and want to see how much K in their diet controls it. To the manufacturer: PLEASE add potassium to labeling under the sodium. Thanks.<br /><br />I love, love that amazon offers this on subcribe and save. Makes life easier. Thank you, Amazon, for this wonderful addition to your S&S coconut water offerings.<br /><br />Enjoy and be healthy!<br /><br />Update: I emailed Amy & Brian after I posted this review, and lo and behold, they will be adding Potassium and Magnesium to their labels. FYI, here are the counts:<br /><br />Potassium: whole can: 780, 8 oz serving: 360<br />Magnesium: whole can: 31.2, 8 oz servinng: 14.4<br /><br />I confirmed that A&B is \"flash pasteurized\", and got email from them to prove it,  which is the same pasteurization used for the tetra paks, as I understand it, so the nutrients should be comparable. They heat their at a lower temp than, say, Zico's, but for a bit longer. If you google \"Crossfit Adventure\" and this coconut water brand name, you'll see the article about the specifics: A&B heats their juice to 160-165 degrees for 15-20 seconds so that the nutrient content is undiminished. Also, the can is not BPA - it is Aqualure 900~19%. The other brand I liked the taste of, Nature Factor, does heat up their CW to a very high degree, so that one may be of concern nutrients-wise.

Talk about variety. I have to say that my second order of Amy & Brian's is not as nice-tasting as the first. My first batch was really delicious and natural tasting. The second order tastes like candy-water. Seriously, it has an unnaturally sweet, unusual flavor. It's still not as offputting as the sour/cereal taste of the bottled Zico, but it's not something I'd recommend. So, a warning--you might get a great batch or a not so great one. But I thought you needed to know that flavor is not consistent (and it wasn't with original Zico, the one I used to drink the most, as coconuts will differ, coconut from coconut, therefore coconut water will have certain inconsistencies unless it's \"jiggered\" for consistency.)  I hope, if you ordered, your batch is wonderful. But I am reconsidering my subscription, cause this variation is just a bit too disparate (a little change is fine, but from amazing to odd-sugary-candy-water will not do.) I have to amend my rating to three stars. HTH.<br /><br />Update July 12, 2010: Okay, I couldn't resist the sale this month that gives me A&B for half off, so I ordered the large/tall can in the pulp version. FANTASTIC. It seems that every case I've gotten in the Tall cans is great. All the cases in the small cans are horrible. So, take my advice: skip these 10 oz cans and get the tall version of A&B, either with or without pulp. Delicious. A&B needs to research why those small cans are so bad versus the tasty and coconutty tall ones.",

                    "user_review": "Please read my update at the end of this original review:<br /><br />I've been sampling various amazon-available coconut wataers since my previous beloved Zico went nasty (from concentrate, sour, sodium enhanced, yuck). I've had and enjoyed O.N.E. in the tetra pak and Nature Factor's organic in a can. I've had and not liked as much VitaCoco. Previously, I had tried supermarket brands like Goya and Conchita. I'm always willing to try coconut water, looking for good price and great taste. I decided to try Amy & Brian's cause I learned about them from googling \"coconut water taste tests\" due to wanting to see what others thought of the brands out there. One taste test comparison mentioned this one tasted most like the actual coconut that was used in the taste test for comparison. Another taste test gave A&B props, too. So, yeah, got my attention.<br /><br />This one is now my new fave. Second fave is Nature Factor's organic one. After that O.N.E.<br /><br />I can say this to coconu water lovers: those above are definitely worth trying to see if you enjoy them, too, before you decide on a permanent subscription. I'm gonna order some more A&B CW very soon (I have 2.5 cases of Nature Factor's, and about 4 tetras left of the O.N.E., and I will drink those. I have 35 bottles left of the Zico (new formula) and I may just water my gardenia and hibiscus bushes with those.)<br /><br />What makes this one a bit different than the good brands I've named:<br /><br />Big can: 17.5 ounces. If you're really thirsty, this one is welcome. (I often drink two 10 ounce cans of Nature Factor's brand during supper, so having one can do the trick is handy).<br /><br />Sweeter: Maybe it's where they get their coconuts from, but this brand has a delicious sweetness that is lacking on ONE, VitaCoco, Zico (old and new), and Harvest Bay. Nature Factor's is a bit sweeter than the previous, but Amy and Brian beats them all. I like sweet. :D  Because another reviewer called it \"unnaturally sweet\", I emailed Amy & Brian via their website to ask if this is from concentrate or has sugar added or manipulated. I was told it's juice as it came from the coconuts, not from concentrate, no sugar added. So, I'm content.<br /><br />Some facts:<br /><br />8 oz = 76 calories<br />This is more than ounce per ounce for other brands, but this is probably explained by the sweetness (meaning more natural carbs). Worth noting for those who are on low-carb/carb-conscious diets. For the rest, it just means MORE FLAVOR.<br /><br />I wish Amy & Brian would put the potassium count on the label, though. This matters to a lot of us, including those who need to watch K intake due to drugs that spare potassium or folks who have high blood pressure and want to see how much K in their diet controls it. To the manufacturer: PLEASE add potassium to labeling under the sodium. Thanks.<br /><br />I love, love that amazon offers this on subcribe and save. Makes life easier. Thank you, Amazon, for this wonderful addition to your S&S coconut water offerings.<br /><br />Enjoy and be healthy!<br /><br />Update: I emailed Amy & Brian after I posted this review, and lo and behold, they will be adding Potassium and Magnesium to their labels. FYI, here are the counts:<br /><br />Potassium: whole can: 780, 8 oz serving: 360<br />Magnesium: whole can:  31.2, 8 oz servinng: 14.4<br /><br />A&B is \"flash pasteurized\", which is the same pasteurization used for the tetra paks, as I understand it, so the nutrients should be comparable. They heat their at a lower temp than, say, Zico's, but for a bit longer. If you google \"Crossfit Adventure\" and this coconut water brand name, you'll see the article about the specifics: A&B heats their juice to 160-165 degrees for 15-20 seconds so that the nutrient content is undiminished. Also, the can is not BPA - it is Aqualure 900~19%. The other brand I liked the taste of, Nature Factor, does heat up their CW to a very high degree, so that one may be of concern nutrients-wise. Not A&B.<br /><br />They use Thai coconuts. :)<br /><br />Addendum: For carb watchers-- The carb count for A&B is roughly twice that of others. I used the brands I had at hand at home (and a calculator) to save you time making comparisons. The number stands for carbs per ounce:<br /><br />Amy & Brian: 2.375<br />Nature Factor Organic: 1.6<br />O.N.E.: 1.33<br />New Zico (from concentrate): 1.07<br /><br />I think Old Zico was more like ONE in terms of carbs per ounce.<br /><br />I wonder if, since the selection of coconuts can give higher sodium (see new Zico's much higher sodium count), then can the selection also be targeted to have higher carbs/more sweetness?<br /><br />HTH<br /><br />UPDATE: WHOA! Talk about variety. I have to say that my second order of Amy & Brian's is not as nice-tasting as the first. My first batch was really delicious and natural tasting. The second order in the 10 oz cans tastes like candy-water. Seriously, it has an unnaturally sweet, unusual flavor. It's still not as offputting as the sour/cereal taste of the bottled Zico, but it's not something I'd recommend. So, a warning--you might get a great batch or a not so great one. But I thought you needed to know that flavor is not consistent (and it wasn't with original Zico, the one I used to drink the most, as coconuts will differ, coconut from coconut, therefore coconut water will have certain inconsistencies unless it's \"jiggered\" for consistency.) I hope, if you ordered, your batch is wonderful. But I am reconsidering my subscription, cause this variation is just a bit too disparate (a little change is fine, but from amazing to odd-sugary-candy-water will not do.) I have to amend my rating to three stars. Hope the update helps you in making a decision.<br /><br />Update July 12, 2010: Yes, I ordered two more cases of large cans of this brand in the pulp version, and it's fantastic. So, it seems the \"badness\" is limited (so far as I can tell) to the smaller cans. I'm editing the header of this review accordingly. Every single large can/case I've ordered has been delicious and refreshing and coconutty. The small cans are candy water and suck.So, AVOID THE SMALL cans until that problem is resolved. But I trust the taste of the large cans to have placed an order for 7 cases during this month's super sale of A&B. HTH.",

Today, ZICO has become the choice of endurance athletes as a natural part of hydration. We invite you to take the Naturally Powered Pledge and embrace the ZICO lifestyle at ZICO.com.

As a company, we\u2019re on a mission to tell the world that Mother Nature made a better sports drink: ZICO Pure Premium Coconut Water. We\u2019re athletes. We drink ZICO daily (lots of it!), know it works, and want to help others make the switch to ZICO too. We also think coconut water can become an important alternative agricultural product for the developing world and are committed to bringing you ZICO in a socially and environmentally responsible and sustainable way. Naturally Powered,Team ZICO PRODUCT BENEFITS ABOUT ZICO ZICO 11-oz. and 1-liter tetra cartons are produced in Thailand and deliver a light, refreshing taste and a nuttier flavor profile, similar to fresh green Thai coconuts from the grocery store.

Now that Zico is horrible (tastes and smells funny), I needed a new coconut water for my daily fix. I decided to try this since amazon offered it to me in a Gold Box Deal. Well, it arrived today and I LOVE IT.<br /><br />It has a nice sweetness and a clean taste and it's got that refreshing quality that chilled coconut water gives. Heck, I even like it at room temperature. It's not the stinky-sour horror Zico now is.<br /><br />I also like that it's organic. That's a bonus!<br /><br />I agree with the other reviewer that the can is great for chilling it up real cold.<br /><br />UPDATE: Apparently, this brand pasteurizes at quite high temps, so there is a legitimate concern that it loses nutrient content. I therefore recommend that, for those who want more than just a great taste, you either email the company and confirm if they have switched to flash pasteurization, or switch to Amy and Brian's (which flash pateurizes and has a BPA free container).<br /><br />I disagree with the reviewer that says those other brands are tastier. I grew up drinking coconut water (my dad would split them open with a machete for us to sip straight out of the coconut), and this one tops O.N.E., which has been my Zico substitute until now,  and VitaCoco (which I do agree is sourish and way down the choice list). But what \"tastes good\" is subjective and we won't agree on best taste. But I can tell you this tastes really close to real coconut water fresh from a tree in your backyard (though nothing beats the real, fresh thing). I'm assuming changes in flavor are to be expected since coconut water will vary from nut to nut. Even Zico was not consistent formerly, sometimes sweeter, sometimes more water, depending, I assume, on the batch of coconuts. Any drink that's from actual fresh juice will have variations (and I guess Zico went to concentrate in part to standardize the flavor). So, I may just have a crazy good batch here in my hands. :)<br /><br />I've just signed on for a subscription and three cases are on their way to me, yay! Thanks, Amazon, for this alternative now that I'm exiled from Zico. Heh.<br /><br />Update: I tried Amy and Brian's CW after this one, and I actually prefer the A&B due to the sweetness. It has that lovely light, clean, fresh taste that Nature Factor has, just sweeter. That may not be the best for everyone (some folks will want it less sweet, not more, due to the difference in carbs). But for me, I love sweetness, so I'm hooked. But you can't go wrong with either NF or A&B. Enjoy either or both--as I will. So great to discover fabulous new beverages that are healthful.<br /><br />Addendum re Potassium: This possible potassium-compromising may end up being great for those who want, not just organic, but to minimize potassium intake but enjoy coconut water (ie, those on Ace Inhibitors or potassium sparing drugs, those with kidney function issues). I'd check with the company first--definitely-- to make sure of actual postassium content before considering it safe for the K-avoiding crowd. Something to consider, though, what with so many Americans on high blood pressure meds. But until the company confirms or denies or makes clear what it's ACTUAL end-product electrolytes/Potassium content is, K-avoiders should avoid all coconut water unless your docs okay it.",

It's not too sweet, and the citrus enhancement (via tangerine puree and flavor) is pleasant, that brisk/brightness of tangerine. It overpowers the mild coconut flavor, but that's expected anytime a stronger flavor (whether mango or peach or citrus or whatever) is added. You can still sense the coconut undertone (for some reason, particularly around the edges of the tongue, while the citrus seems to hit dead center more strongly).<br /><br />I like this one a lot.

In my mind, I was comparing it to fresh coconut water (which is available here in Miami and I drink when I can).<br /><br />I deleted that old review and am rereviewing it as a 5-star product. After trying  half dozen different coconut waters in cans and cartons, I keep coming back to Zico. In fact, I subscribed to it and get a case monthly (and sometimes, I order two cases).<br /><br />This is really the best of the lot offered on Amazon (and I have ordered O.N.E and Vita Coco when they came on sale here). I even had a taste test at one--drinking sips from all three, one by one. Zico beats the other two, easy.<br /><br />Here is the original review from 2006:<br />~~The reviewers who say this is an acquired taste are correct. Most folks don't grow up drinking lovely coconut water, chilled, right out of the coconut shell. And that's a pity, because on a hot day, that does the trick better than soda or any other juice.<br /><br />Zico, while not being exactly like the real and unprocessed thing, is quite close. It's refreshing chilled, and it doesn't have the ton of sugar some brands add. (If you like it sweet, add your own Splenda and get sweetness without the extra calories most Americans like me don't need.) But honestly, it's good to go as is.<br /><br />I find it goes nicely with Thai foods, natural eats, and by itself after some sweaty work. Lovely. And good for the blood pressure.<br /><br />Now, can amazon get some more in stock please. I really need a couple more cases! ~~<br /><br />This is now a staple in my house, so I think it well-earned it's 5 Star RE-review. In fact, it's one of my pre-workout drinks, because the high Potassium content keeps cramps at bay when I'm really having a tough Pilates session with my trainer.<br /><br />Thanks, Zico. This is a top-notch product (and I just had a carton, too!) Please don't go out of business! I need my daily Zico fix!<br /><br />BTW, I don't much like the flavored varieties.

Each Package Contains: 6 boxes of 18-20 tea bags (116 tea bags total). Contains Caffeine. Flavors Include: Super Irish Breakfast - This Super Irish Breakfast blend is truly \"the espresso\" of teas. While Irish Breakfast is usually blended with an Assam tea base, this Super Irish Breakfast has even more Assam, which makes the tea maltier, richer and more full-bodied Breakfast In Paris - Meet your new tea crush. This lavender Earl Grey tea was named after the City of Love, because this blend of lavender, bergamot citrus, and vanilla will have you longing to brew up cup after cup. Chai Spice - This is not a quiet, predictable tea. This is a spiced chai tea. And it\u2019s stacked with great flavor from the perfect blend of premium blended black teas and chai spices. Double Bergamot Earl Grey - We went the extra mile to make this extraordinary tea extra bold with extra bergamot oil. We even sourced it from the extra sunny orchards of Calabria, Italy. When you taste the extra citrus oil we added to this famous mix, you'll agree... *Italian accent* It's-delizioso! Orange Spice - This Orange Spice tea blend full-bodied black teas with the finest cinnamon, orange peel, and orange oil. The result is a very aromatic tea that has the flavor of zesty orange and spicy cinnamon. Peach - This caffeinated peach black tea is bursting with juicy peach flavors. It makes a delicious sweet peach iced tea, unsweetened iced tea, or hot drink.",

                            "The Stash Tea Company is headquartered in Tigard, Oregon, a suburb of Portland. Founded in 1972, Stash Tea originally operated out of an old Portland Victorian style house, supplying loose herbal teas and bulk herbs to natural food stores. Starting in 1975, the company broadened its focus to include bagged teas and then began to sell a full line of traditional, specialty blend and herbal teas directly to fine restaurants and through a mail-order catalog to consumers. Today, Stash Tea is enjoying steady growth and has become one of the largest specialty tea companies in the United States, with products available through foodservice, grocery stores, tea and coffee shops, club stores, mass merchandisers, natural foods stores, mail order, and the Internet. Stash Tea is also available in Canada and in several foreign countries.",
                            "The company derives its name from an entertaining aspect of tea folklore. In earlier centuries, tea was a valuable commodity traditionally transported by clipper ship. The ship's captain often was presented with some of the finest teas for his personal use. This supply was his \"stash,\" stowed carefully as his \"private reserve.\" Today, the term still is used to denote anything put away carefully because of its preciousness.",

                            "Since 1972, Stash has been committed to providing premium quality teas and an unsurpassed tea drinking experience. Stash begins with simply excellent tea leaves from the world's premier tea gardens and all natural botanical ingredients gathered from around the world. Meticulous blending and tasting of every tea ensures you will enjoy full flavor in every cup. Herbal teas contain no true tea leaves, but are created from an international collection of herbs and spices such as Moroccan rosebuds, Oregon mint, tropical hibiscus, cinnamon from Indonesia, and more. These all-natural botanical ingredients are combined to create exciting flavors and aromas in a rainbow of colors from pale yellow to deep red. Each Stash herbal tea has a unique taste and aroma.",

It includes both decaf and caffeinated teas and provides a wonderful range of flavors to suit many tastes.  It is especially nice when you have visitors, because you can offer them a lovely range of choices.  Stash teas are my favorite for herbal teas.  And, their green and black teas are fine as well.  They have true, distinctive flavors including ones to relax with, ones to warm you up, and lots to enjoy any time.  This sampler lets you sample a wide range of Stash teas.",

I like the decaf version of black tea, same good taste, and I can have a cup in the evening without it keeping me up all night.  The various fruit teas are each nice in their own way.  I am particularly pleased with the chamomile, as it is not only good, but good for you.  Chamomile is my grandmothers sure cure for stomach problems, and this version is as good as the chamomile straight from Grandma's garden.  Now that I have had the samples, I can go ahead and order my favorites in regular sizes.  The samples are also nice to put out when we have visitors, so they can pick what suits their fancy.",

Each packet contains three thin \u201ccookies\u201d that, combined, amount to one pretty filling serving (180 calories). They are not as chewy as the cranberry variety, not as crunchy either, but otherwise they\u2019re pretty good. They remind me of the venerable Garibaldi biscuit. With a 10:1 carbs to protein ratio (29 g carbs, 12 g sugars, 3 grams protein) they are a bit heavy on carbs and sugar, but also contain a lot of fiber (11% DV), low sodium, and a good fat balance. The first three ingredients are whole oat flour, raisins, and whole oats, so they\u2019re \u201cheart-healthy\u201d in that sense.<br /><br />However, I also want to look at the social and environmental impact of this product \u2013 and will give it a separate \u201cgreen star\u201d rating of 2/5 green stars. On the plus side, oats are a pretty sustainable crop \u2013 they have lower needs for water, fertilizer, and tilling. Unfortunately, none of the ingredients are organically grown, and if it matters to you it does also contain some GMO ingredients (they are good enough to disclose this, and on the website they acknowledge that their oat crops are sprayed with Glyphosate). Quaker is owned by PepsiCo, so it\u2019s necessary to take that into account when making an assessment. Pepsi have been slow to improve on social and environmental issues, such as sourcing palm oil responsibly (there\u2019s no palm oil in these Quaker bars but purchasing them does still support PepsiCo). It looks like Quaker haven\u2019t updated their \u201cOats and the Environment\u201d page (which deals with some of their sustainability goals) since the last decade \u2013 they are leaving that to Pepsi now, I guess. Pepsi\u2019s CSR report is full of vague statements \u2013 for example, they are happy that their greenhouse gas emissions have remained flat for their older plants. If you look at their more detailed \u201cGRI\u201d report you can see how their total GHG emissions have gone up 40% between 2008 and 2014. Without going into every detail on their social and environmental impact I\u2019d say that (tasty as these Quaker bars are) I don\u2019t feel like supporting Quaker/PepsiCo. Besides, I\u2019m pretty sure we can make healthier, tastier and more sustainable bars at home without too much effort.",

However, even though it is unashamedly one of the driest bars I\u2019ve ever tasted, it actually worked for me. The trick, perhaps, is to think of it as more of a biscuit than a bar \u2013 it\u2019s kind of reminiscent of the Garibaldi biscuit \u2013 apparently one of the oldest and most venerable biscuits out there. Like the Garibaldi, it\u2019s dry, crispy and contains something to give it a little texture/chew (chocolate chips in this case). They weren\u2019t difficult to eat (even without a drink) even though they are so dry. These lightweight bars (180 cal in a 40g pack) could be a good option for trekking. With a 9:1 carbs to protein (27g carbs, 9g sugars, 3 grams protein) they are a little heavier on carbs, but also contain a lot of fiber (13% DV), low sodium, and a good fat balance. They are vegan-friendly, according to the Kashi website.<br /><br />Be warned though, that the box says 10 bars, but there are 5 wrapped packs inside. I would never claim this to be equivalent to 10 granola bars. Each pack of 2 bars is equivalent to a regular bar, so it\u2019s really five total. The first time I bit into it I didn\u2019t realize that it\u2019s actually two bars (biscuits really \u2013 they are very thin) lying on top of each other. You could eat them as one or separate them.<br /><br />Besides the 4/5 gold stars for quality and price I think they deserve 3/5 green stars for social and environmental impact. The ingredients are not organic and the cacao is not Fair Trade certified. Boo. I appreciate that they use expeller-pressed canola oil instead of the all-too-common palm oil.

Kellogg\u2019s are doing a little better than some of the other huge multinational food producers, but they are lagging behind some of the more responsible food bar companies, like Clif Bar.<br /><br />You can get their 2014 Corporate Responsibility Report on their website. They are doing quite well on responsible packaging, diverting waste from landfill, water use, and worker diversity. For example, their numbers on waste generation and water consumption were a little better than those from HAIN (known for their natural food lines). However, they are haven\u2019t made much progress so far this decade on reducing energy use and greenhouse gas emissions.<br /><br />They have a target of 2020 for responsible sourcing of ingredients from rice and corn to cacao and berries.<br />They also have a collaborative system (Sedex, the Supplier Ethical Data Exchange) for making sure suppliers are in compliance.

I thought the chewy Chocolate Almond and Sea Salt with Chia bars were a little better than these \u2013 tastier and less dry. These Mocha bars are way too dry for my taste, even when I eat them with a drink. In person, they don\u2019t look nearly as tasty or as almond-rich as the bar pictured on the box, and then they also taste worse than they look. The flavor doesn\u2019t translate as mocha, and there\u2019s very little chocolate flavor either.<br /><br />I think people will be drawn to them for nutritional content, and I think it\u2019s pretty well balanced when you look at overall content. It has a carbs to protein ratio of 3.5 to 1, which is close to what\u2019s considered optimal; low in fat, very high in fiber and moderate in sodium. So the overall balance (3.5 g fat, 4 g fiber, 6 g sugar, and 6 g protein) is pretty good from a purely accounting point of view. I don\u2019t love that the protein comes in the form of soy protein isolate however (i.e. the leftovers after oil has been extracted from soybeans with hexane) but that\u2019s common to most non-organic bars that use soy protein.<br /><br />Their newer bars are organic and made with several Fair Trade certified ingredients (including cacao) but unfortunately they fall apart when you unwrap them. These chewy bars hold together better but are not made with Fair Trade certified cacao and that\u2019s disappointing. They need a combination of good ingredients and well-made bars. Kashi is also a company of contradictions. For example, they are proud of their new non-GMO products (this is not one of them) and yet in 2012 their parent company, Kellogg, donated $790,000 to the NO on Prop. 37 campaign (labeling of GMO foods). They were also I the news in 2012 for misleading labeling of products as natural (and using GMO ingredients) \u2013 the Kashi's general manager responded by stating, \u201cThe FDA has chosen not to regulate the term 'natural.\u2019\u201d Overall I feel that they are a mix of good intentions and some bad practices that have seeped in as the company grew (and was acquired by the Kellogg Company). The ingredients are not too bad: for example there\u2019s expeller-pressed canola/safflower oil instead of palm oil, which is nice; but I feel that there are too many \u2013 it tastes like a highly processed product. Since it contains wheat, nuts, soy and milk, that excludes a lot of people these days!<br /><br />I feel that overall, for social and environmental impact, Kashi is a little above average, and even Kellogg (the parent company) is setting decent goals these days on things like energy use, waste, ingredient sourcing, etc., even working with the WWF to evaluate impact for their products. These particular bars however, not having organic (except for the cane syrup) or Fair Trade certified ingredients, deserve a middle-of-the-road 3/5 green stars for social and environmental impact and also 3/5 gold stars for overall quality.",

With whole, roasted almonds, succulent, sun-dried fruit, toasted sunflower seeds and a touch of wildflower honey, our trail mix granola bars have 4 gram of fiber and 6 gram of protein.

I think people will be drawn to them for nutritional content, and I think it\u2019s pretty well balanced when you look at overall content.

The sweetener used, brown rice syrup, is really no better than sugar if you look into it, so there\u2019s no healthy benefit there. However, the overall balance (4 g fat, 4 g fiber, 7 g sugar, and 6 g protein) is pretty good from a purely accounting point of view. I don\u2019t love that the protein comes in the form of soy protein isolate however (i.e. the leftovers after oil has been extracted from soybeans with hexane) but that\u2019s common to most non-organic bars that use soy protein.<br /><br />Their newer bars are organic and made with several Fair Trade certified ingredients (including cacao) but unfortunately they fall apart when you unwrap them.

Since it contains wheat, nuts, soy and milk, that excludes a lot of people these days!<br /><br />I feel that overall, for social and environmental impact, Kashi is a little above average, and even Kellogg (the parent company) is setting decent goals these days on things like energy use, waste, ingredient sourcing, etc., even working with the WWF to evaluate impact for their products.

                    "user_review": "I eat Kashi cereal sometimes so I was interested in trying their bars to see how they compare. They taste decent \u2013 not outstanding but not like cardboard either. But they are a little dry for my taste, so I think they fare best with a drink. The chocolate and salt kick both come across well even though it\u2019s not high in salt. I think people will be drawn to them for nutritional content, and I think it\u2019s pretty well balanced when you look at overall content. It has a carbs to protein ratio of 3.5 to 1, which is close to what\u2019s considered optimal; low in fat, very high in fiber and moderate in sodium.<br /><br />It also contains some ALA \u2013 not a huge selling point since 1-2 grams per day of ALA is recommended and one Kashi bar provides 160 mg (you can get a full and more full and well-rounded dose of omega-3 fatty acids with 2 tbs of flaxseeds or \u00bc cup of walnuts). The sweetener used, brown rice syrup, is really no better than sugar if you look into it, so there\u2019s no healthy benefit there. However, the overall balance (4 g fat, 4 g fiber, 7 g sugar, and 6 g protein) is pretty good from a purely accounting point of view. I don\u2019t love that the protein comes in the form of soy protein isolate however (i.e. the leftovers after oil has been extracted from soybeans with hexane) but that\u2019s common to most non-organic bars that use soy protein.<br /><br />Their newer bars are organic and made with several Fair Trade certified ingredients (including cacao) but unfortunately they fall apart when you unwrap them. These chewy bars hold together better but are not made with Fair Trade certified cacao and that\u2019s disappointing. They need a combination of good ingredients and well-made bars. Kashi is also a company of contradictions. For example, they are proud of their new non-GMO products (this is not one of them) and yet in 2012 their parent company, Kellogg, donated $790,000 to the NO on Prop. 37 campaign (labeling of GMO foods). They were also I the news in 2012 for misleading labeling of products as natural (and using GMO ingredients) \u2013 the Kashi's general manager responded by stating, \u201cThe FDA has chosen not to regulate the term 'natural.\u2019\u201d Overall I feel that they are a mix of good intentions and some bad practices that have seeped in as the company grew (and was acquired by the Kellogg Company). The ingredients are not too bad: for example there\u2019s expeller-pressed canola/safflower oil instead of palm oil, which is nice; but I feel that there are too many \u2013 it feels like a highly processed product. Since it contains wheat, nuts, soy and milk, that excludes a lot of people these days!<br /><br />I feel that overall, for social and environmental impact, Kashi is a little above average, and even Kellogg (the parent company) is setting decent goals these days on things like energy use, waste, ingredient sourcing, etc., even working with the WWF to evaluate impact for their products. These particular bars however, not having organic (except for the cane syrup) or Fair Trade certified ingredients, deserve a middle-of-the-road 3/5 green stars for social and environmental impact and also 3/5 gold stars for overall quality.",

Any chili head will tell you that there are two main considerations when it comes to hot sauce: flavor and heat.  As far as heat goes, this is pretty mild for a Reaper based sauce.  It still has some kick, and people who are not used to hot food will have a rough time with it.  The flavor is fantastic with a smoky profile and a bit of a reaper taste to it.  Overall, I would give it:  Flavor 8/10, Heat 6/10.",

This stuff is definitely hot, so anyone who isn't used to reaper-level heat should stay away.  The flavor has a very overpowering Reaper taste and not so much of a garlic taste.  You can't really taste much besides the Reapers.  I won't buy it again because I have sauces that taste better and/or are hotter depending on my mood.  All around good sauce, it just doesn't stand out among the rest.",
